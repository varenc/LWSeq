Introduction: <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1xh/living_luminously/">Living
Luminously</A></H1>
<P><STRONG>The following posts may be useful background
material:</STRONG><A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1mu/sorting_out_sticky_brains/">Sorting
Out Sticky Brains</A>;<A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1ty/mental_crystallography/">Mental
Crystallography</A>;<A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/">Generalizing
From One Example</A></P>
<P><BR>I took the word &quot;luminosity&quot; from &quot;Knowledge
and its Limits&quot; by Timothy Williamson, although I'm using it in
a different sense than he did. (He referred to &quot;being in a
position to know&quot; rather than actually knowing, and in his
definition, he doesn't quite restrict himself to mental states and
events.) The original ordinary-language sense of &quot;luminous&quot;
means &quot;emitting light, especially self-generated light; easily
comprehended; clear&quot;, which should put the titles into context.</P>
<P>Luminosity, as I'll use the term, is self-awareness. A luminous
mental state is one that you have and know that you have. It could be
an emotion, a belief or alief, a disposition, a quale, a memory -
anything that might happen or be stored in your brain. What's going
on in your head? What you come up with when you ponder that question
- assuming, nontrivially, that you are accurate - is what's luminous
to you. Perhaps surprisingly, it's hard for a lot of people to tell.
Even if they can identify the occurrence of individual mental events,
they have tremendous difficulty modeling their cognition over time,
explaining why it unfolds as it does, or observing ways in which it's
changed. With sufficient luminosity, you can inspect your own
experiences, opinions, and stored thoughts. You can watch them
interact, and discern patterns in how they do that. This lets you
predict what you'll think - and in turn, what you'll do - in the
future under various possible circumstances.</P>
<P>I've made it a project to increase my luminosity as much as
possible over the past several years. While I am not (yet) perfectly
luminous, I have already realized considerable improvements in such
subsidiary skills like managing my mood, hacking into some of the
systems that cause akrasia and other non-endorsed behavior, and
simply being less confused about why I do and feel the things I do
and feel. I have some reason to believe that I am substantially more
luminous than average, because I can ask people what seem to me to be
perfectly easy questions about what they're thinking and find them
unable to answer. Meanwhile, I'm not trusting my mere impression that
I'm generally right when I come to conclusions about myself. My
models of myself, after I stop tweaking and toying with them and
decide they're probably about right, are borne out a majority of the
time by my ongoing behavior. Typically, they'll also match what other
people conclude about me, at least on some level.</P>
<P>In this sequence, I hope to share some of the techniques for
improving luminosity that I've used. I'm optimistic that at least
some of them will be useful to at least some people. However, I may
be a walking, talking &quot;results not typical.&quot; My prior
attempts at improving luminosity in others consist of me asking
individually-designed questions in real time, and that's gone fairly
well; it remains to be seen if I can distill the basic idea into a
format that's generally accessible.</P>
<P>I've divided up the sequence into eight posts, not including this
one, which serves as introduction and index. (I'll update the titles
in the list below with links as each post goes up.)</P>

Are Likely To Be Eaten By A Grue</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM>Luminosity is fun, useful to others, and
important in self-improvement. You should learn about it with this
sequence.</EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Luminosity? Pah! Who needs it?</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It's a legitimate question. The typical human gets
through life with astonishingly little introspection, much less
careful, accurate introspection. Our models of ourselves are
sometimes even worse than our models of each other - we have more
data, but also more biases loading up our reflection with noise. Most
of the time, most people act on their emotions and beliefs directly,
without the interposition of self-aware deliberation. And this
doesn't usually seem to get anyone maimed or killed - when was the
last time a gravestone read &quot;Here Lies Our Dear Taylor, Who
Might Be Alive Today With More Internal Clarity About The Nature Of
Memory Retrieval&quot;? Nonsense. If Taylor needs to remember
something, it'll present itself, or not, and if there's a chronic
problem with the latter then Taylor can export memories to <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/11f/the_great_brain_is_located_externally/">the
environment</A>. Figuring out how the memories are stored in the
first place and tweaking that is not high on the to-do list.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Still, I think it's worth investing considerable
time and effort into improving your luminosity. I submit three
reasons why this is so.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>First, you are a fascinating creature. It's just
plain fun and rewarding to delve into your own mind. People in
general are among the most complex, intriguing things in the world.
You're no less so. You have lived a fair number of observer-moments.
Starting with a native architecture that is pretty special all by
itself, you've accumulated a complex set of filters by which you
interpret your input - remembered past, experienced present, and
anticipated future. You like things; you want things; you believe
things; you expect things; you feel things. There's a lot of stuff
rolled up and tucked into the fissures of your brain. Wouldn't you
like to know what it is? Particularly because it's you. Many people
find themselves to be their favorite topics. Are you an exception?
(There's one way to find out...)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Second, an accurate model of yourself can help you
help others deal with you in the best possible way. Right now,
they're probably using kludgey agglomerations of self-projection,
stereotype, and automatically generated guesses that they may not
bother to update as they learn more about you. I'm assuming you don't
surround yourself with hostile people who would use accurate data
about you to hurt and manipulate you, but if you do, certainly be
judicious with whatever information your quest for luminosity
supplies. As for everyone else, their having a better model of you
will avoid a lot of headaches on everyone's parts. I'll present
myself as an example: I hate surprises. Knowing this, and being able
to tell a complete and credible story about how this works, I can
explain to people who might wish to exchange gifts why they should
not spring unknown wrapped items on me, and avoid that source of
irritation. Most of the people around me choose not to take actions
that they know will irritate me; but without a detailed explanation
of exactly preferences are uncommon, they'll all too easily revert to
their base model of a generic person.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Third, and most germane to the remaining posts in
this sequence: with a better picture of who you are and what your
brain is up to, you can find the best low-hanging fruit in terms of
hacks to <EM>change </EM>yourself. If you keep going from point A to
point Z, but know nothing about the route in between, then the only
way you can avoid a disliked Z is to try to come to a screeching halt
right before it happens. If you could monitor the process from the
start, and determine what pattern your mind follows along the
alphabet, you might find that you can easily intervene at G or Q, and
never have to deal with Z again. Similarly, if you try to go from
alpha to omega but tend not to wind up at omega, how are you ever
going to determine where your obstructions lie unless you pay
attention to something other than the bare fact of non-omega? There
could be some trivial omicron-related problem that you'd fix in a
heartbeat if only you knew it was getting in the way. Additionally,
your faulty models of yourself are already<EM> changing you through</EM>
such miraculous means as cognitive dissonance. Unless you find out
how it's doing that, you lose the chance to monitor and control the
process.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>An analogy: You're waiting to be picked up at the
airport. The designated time comes and goes, and you're sitting by
the baggage claim with your suitcases at your feet, your eyes on your
watch, and a frown on your face. The person was supposed to pick you
up at<EM> the airport</EM>, and isn't there! A clear failure has
occurred! But if you phone the person and start screaming &quot;The
airport, you fool! I'm at the airport! Why aren't you?&quot; then
this will tend not to improve things unless the person never left in
the first place out of forgetfulness. If they're stuck in traffic, or
were sent out of their way by road construction, or have gotten
hopelessly lost, or have been identified by the jackbooted thugs that
keep watch at the airport parking lot as a terrorist, reiterating
that you had this particular goal in mind won't help. And unless you
find<EM> out what is keeping them</EM>, you can't help. You have to
know where they are to tell them what detours to take to avoid rush
hour; you have to know what diversions were introduced to tell them
how to rejoin their planned route; you have to know what landmarks
they can see to know where they've gone missing to; you have to know
whether to go make Bambi eyes at the security guards and plead
misunderstanding. Without rather specific, sensitive data about
what's gone wrong, you can't make it right.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In the next posts of this sequence, I'm going to
illustrate some methods that have helped me learn more about myself
and change what I don't like. With luck, they'll assist you on the
project that I've just attempted to convince you to want to
undertake.</P>

sounds good, and move on.</EM></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="text-align: justify">Maria likes compliments. She
<EM>loves </EM>compliments. And when she doesn't get enough of them
to suit her, she starts fishing, asking plaintive questions, making
doe eyes to draw them out. It's starting to annoy people. Lately,
instead of compliments, she's getting barbs and criticism and
snappish remarks. It hurts - and it seems to hurt her more than it
hurts others when they hear similar things. Maria wants to know what
it is about her that would explain all of this. So she starts taking
personality tests and looking for different styles of maintaining and
thinking about relationships, looking for something that describes
her. Eventually, she runs into a concept called &quot;love languages&quot;
and realizes at once that she's a &quot;words&quot; person. Her
friends aren't trying to hurt her - they don't realize how much she
thrives on compliments, or how deeply insults can cut when they're
dealing with someone who transmits affection verbally. Armed with
this concept, she has a lens through which to interpret patterns of
her own behavior; she also has a way to explain herself to her loved
ones and get the wordy boosts she needs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Where do you
get your priors, when you start modeling yourself seriously instead
of doing it by halfhearted intuition?</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Well, one
thing's for sure: not with the caliber of introspection you're most
likely starting with. If you've spent any time on this site at all,
you know people are riddled with biases and mechanisms for
self-deception that systematically confound us about who we are (&quot;I'm
splendid and brilliant! The last five hundred times I did
non-splendid non-brilliant things were outrageous flukes!&quot;).
Humans suck at most things, and obeying the edict &quot;Know
thyself!&quot; is not a special case.</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The outside

<A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ri/the_outside_views_domain/">rap</A>,
but I'm going to defend it - as a jumping-off point, anyway - when I
fill our luminosity toolbox. There's a major body of literature
designed to figure out just what the hell happens inside our skulls:
it's called psychology, and they have a rather impressive track
record. For instance, learning about <A HREF="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Heuristic">heuristics</A>
and <A HREF="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Bias">biases</A> may let
you detect them in action in yourself. I can often tell when I'm
about to be subject to the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect">bystander
effect</A> (&quot;There is someone sitting in the middle of the road.
Should I call 911? I mean, she's sitting up and everything and there
are non-alarmed people looking at her - but gosh, I probably don't
look alarmed either...&quot;), have made some progress in reducing
the extent to which I <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/">generalize
from one example</A> (&quot;How are you not all driven insane by the
spatters of oil all over the stove?!&quot;), and am suspicious when I
think I might be <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Wobegon_effect">above
average in some way</A> and have no hard data to back it up (&quot;Now
I can be confident that I am in fact good at this sort of problem: I
answered all of these questions and most people can't, according to
someone who has no motivation to lie!&quot;). Now, even if you are a
<A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/17x/beware_of_weird_psychological_samples/">standard
psych study subject</A>, of course you aren't going to align with
every psychological finding ever. They don't even align perfectly
with each other. But - controlling for some huge, obvious factors,
like if you have a mental illness - it's a good place to start.</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">For narrowing
things down beyond what's been turned up as typical human reactions
to things, you can try personality tests like Myers-Briggs or <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">Big
Five</A>. These are not fantastically reliable sources. However, some
of them have some ability to track with some parts of reality.
Accordingly, <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gf/saturation_distillation_improvisation_a_story/">saturate</A>
with all the test data you can stand. Filter it for what sounds right
(&quot;gosh, I guess I do tend to be rather bothered by things out of
place in my environment, compared to others&quot;) and dump the rest
(&quot;huh? I'm not open to experience at all! I won't even try
escargot!&quot;) - these are rough, first-approximation priors, not
posteriors you should actually act on, and you can afford a clumsy
process this early in the game. While you're at it, give some thought
to your <A HREF="http://skyview.vansd.org/lschmidt/Projects/The%20Nine%20Types%20of%20Intelligence.htm">intelligence
types</A>, categorize your <A HREF="http://www.5lovelanguages.com/learn-the-languages/the-five-love-languages/">love
language</A><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>-
anything that carves up person-space and puts you in a bit of it.</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Additionally,
if you have honest friends or relatives, you can ask for their help.
Note that even honest ones will probably have a rosy picture of you:
they can stand to be around you, so they probably aren't paying
excruciatingly close attention to your flaws, and may exaggerate the
importance of your virtues relative to a neutral observer's
hypothetical opinion. They also aren't around you all the time, which
will constrict the circumstances in which their model is tested and
skew it towards whatever influence their own presence has on you.
Their outside perspective is, however, still valuable.</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>(Tips on getting friends/family to provide feedback:
I find musing aloud about myself in an obviously tentative manner to
be fairly useful at eliciting some domain-specific input. Some of my
friends I can ask point-blank, although it helps to ask about
specific situations (&quot;Do you think I'm just tired?&quot; &quot;Was
I over the line back there?&quot;) rather than general traits that
feel more judgmental to discuss (&quot;Am I a jerk?&quot; &quot;Do I
use people?&quot;). When you communicate in text and keep logs, you
can send people pastes of entire conversations (when this is
permissible to your original interlocutor) and ask what your
consultant thinks of that. If you do not remember some event, or are
willing to pretend not to remember the event, then you can get
whoever was with you at the time to recount it from their perspective
- this process will automatically paint what you did during the event
in the light of outside scrutiny.)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>If during your prior-hunting something turns up that
seems <EM>wrong </EM>to you, whether it's a whole test result or some
specific supposed feature of people in a group that seems otherwise
generally fitting, that's great! Now you can rule something out.
Think: what makes the model wrong? When have you done something that
falsified it? (&quot;That one time last week&quot; is more promising
than &quot;back in eighty-nine I think it might have been January&quot;.)
What are the smallest things you could change to make it sit right?
(&quot;Change the word &quot;rapid&quot; to &quot;meticulous&quot;
and that's me to a tee!&quot;) If it helps, take in the information
you gather in small chunks. That way you can inspect them one at a
time, instead of only holistically accepting or rejecting what a
given test tells you.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>If something sounds <EM>right </EM>to you, that's
also great! Ask: what predictions does this idea let you make about
your cognition and behavior? (&quot;Should you happen to meet a tall,
dark stranger, you will make rapid assumptions about his character
based on his body language.&quot;) How could you test them, and
refine the model? (Where do the tall, dark strangers hang out?) If
you've behaved in ways inconsistent with this model in the past, what
exceptions to the rule does that imply and how can you most
concisely, <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/jp/occams_razor/">Occam-esque-ly</A>
summarize them? (&quot;That one tall, dark stranger was wearing a
very cool t-shirt which occluded posture data.&quot;)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Nota bene: you may be tempted to throw out things
because they sound bad (&quot;I can't be a narcissist! That wouldn't
be in keeping with the story I tell about myself!&quot;), rather than
because they sound wrong, and to keep things because they sound good
(&quot;ooh! I'm funny and smart!&quot;), rather than because they
sound right. Recite the Litany of Tarski a few times, if that helps:
if you have a trait, you desire to believe that you have the trait.
If you do not have a trait, you desire to believe that you do not
have the trait. May you not become attached to beliefs you may not
want. If you have bad features, knowing about them won't make them
worse - and might let you fix, work around, or mitigate them. If you
lack good features, deluding yourself about them won't make them
appear - and might cost you opportunities to develop them for real.
If you <EM>can't answer </EM>the questions &quot;when have you done
something that falsified this model?&quot; or &quot;list some
examples of times when you've behaved in accordance with this model&quot;
- second guess. Try again. Think harder. You are not guaranteed to be
right, and being right should be the aim here.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="text-align: justify">Tony's performance at work is
suffering. Not every day, but most days, he's too drained and
distracted to perform the tasks that go into making widgets. He's in
serious danger of falling behind his widget quota and needs to figure
out why. Having just read a fascinating and brilliantly written post
on Less Wrong about luminosity, he decides to keep track of where he
is and what he's doing when he does and doesn't feel the drainedness.
After a week, he's got a fairly robust correlation: he feels worst on
days when he doesn't eat breakfast, which reliably occurs when he's
stayed up too late, hit the snooze button four times, and had to dash
out the door. Awkwardly enough, having been distracted all day tends
to make him work more slowly at making widgets, which makes him less
physically exhausted by the time he gets home and enables him to stay
up later. To deal with that, he starts going for long runs on days
when his work hasn't been very tiring, and pops melatonin; he easily
drops off to sleep when his head hits the pillow at a reasonable

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The single most effective thing you can do when
seeking luminosity is to learn to correlate your ABC's, collecting
data about how three interrelated items interact and appear together
or separately.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>A</B> stands for &quot;affect&quot;. Affect is
how you feel and what's on your mind. It can be far more complicated
than &quot;eh, I'm fine&quot; or &quot;today I'm sad&quot;. You have
room for plenty of simultaneous emotions, and different ones can be
directed at different things - being on a generally even keel about
two different things isn't the same as being nervous about one and
cheerful about the other, and neither state is the same as being
entirely focused on one subject that thrills you to pieces. If you're
nervous about your performance evaluation but tickled pink that you
just bought a shiny new consumer good and looking forward to visiting
your cousin next week yet irritated that you just stubbed your toe,
all while being amused by the funny song on the radio, that's this.
For the sake of the alphabet, I'm lumping in less emotionally laden
cognition here, too - what thoughts occur to you, what chains of
reasoning you follow, what parts of the environment catch your
attention.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>B</B> stands for &quot;behavior&quot;. Behavior
here means <EM>what you actually do</EM>. Include as a dramatically
lower-weighted category those things that you <EM>fully intended to
do</EM>, and <EM>actually moved to do</EM>, but were then prevented
from without from doing, or changed your mind about due to <EM>new,
unanticipated information</EM>. This is critical. Fleeting designs
and intentions cross our minds continually, and if you don't firmly
and definitively place your evidential weight on the things that
ultimately result in action, you will get subconsciously
cherry-picked subsets of those incomplete plan-wisps. This is
particularly problematic because weaker intentions will be dissuaded
by minor environmental complications at a much higher rate. Don't
worry overmuch about &quot;real&quot; plans that this filtering
process discards. You're trying to know yourself<EM> </EM><EM>in
</EM><EM>toto</EM>, not yourself at your best time-slices when you
valiantly meant to do good thing X and were buffeted by circumstance:
if those dismissed real plans represent typical dispositions you
have, then they'll have their share of the cohort of actual behavior.
Trust the law of averages.<BR><BR><B>C</B> stands for &quot;circumstance.&quot;
This is what's going on around you (what time is it? what's going on
in your life now and recently and in the near future - major events,
minor upheavals, plans for later, what people say to you? Where are
you? Is it warm, cold, bright, dim, windy, calm, quiet, noisy,
aromatic, odorless, featureless, busy, colorful, drab, natural,
artificial, pretty, ugly, spacious, cozy, damp, dry, deserted,
crowded, formal, informal, familiar, new, cluttered, or tidy?). It
also covers what you're doing and things inside you that are
generally conceptualized as merely physical (Are you exhausted,
jet-lagged, drugged, thirsty, hungry, sore, ill, drunk, energetic,
itchy, limber, wired, shivering? Are you draped over a recliner,
hiding in a cellar, hang gliding or dancing or hiking or drumming or
hoeing or diving?) Circumstances are a bit easier to observe than
affect and behavior. If you have trouble telling where you are and
what you're up to, your first priority shouldn't be luminosity. And
while we often have <EM>some </EM>trouble distinguishing between
various physical ailments, there are strong pressures on our species
to be able to tell when we're hungry or in <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/14n/pain/">pain</A>.
Don't neglect circumstance when performing correlative exercises just
because it doesn't seem as &quot;the contents of your skull&quot;-y.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder">SAD</A>
should be evidence enough that our environments <EM>can </EM>profoundly
influence our feelings. And wouldn't it be <EM>weird</EM>, after all,
if you felt and acted just the same while ballroom dancing, and while
setting the timer on your microwave oven to reheat soup, and while
crouching on the floor after having been taken hostage at the bank?</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>All of these things are interdependent:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>A</B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>→</B></FONT><B>B</B>:
	Your affect influences your behavior most directly - affect, after
	all, captures what you're thinking and feeling, and apart from
	purely reflexive actions, you're going to act in response to that.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>C</B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>→</B></FONT><B>B</B>:
	Circumstance also feeds very obviously into behavior. You cannot

	skirt around when I'm wearing yoga pants.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>A</B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>→</B></FONT><B>C</B>:
	Affect can change your circumstances via your behavior, but also by
	altering what happens to your body's condition (we should all be
	familiar with how stress, for instance, can make you feel
	physically) and through your fellow human beings by virtue of
	nonverbal visibility.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>B</B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>→</B></FONT><B>C</B>:
	Your behavior influences your circumstances, obviously - smash a

	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>B</B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>→</B></FONT><B>A</B>:
	Behavior can feed back into affect through hardwired two-way
	connections (smile and your emotions smile with you!) and through
	things like consistency effects, which make you become more like the
	person you seem to behaviorally emulate.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>C</B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>→</B></FONT><B>A</B>:
	Your circumstances mess with your affect both consciously, through
	perception and knowledge (&quot;it's my birthday! yay!&quot;), and
	subconsciously, via physical effects (if you are operating on
	excessive sleep debt you will not be pleased with the results).</P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>So don't <EM>just </EM>correlate how they appear
together: also note cause and effect relationships. Until you've
developed enough luminosity to detect these things directly, you may
have to fall back on a little post-hoc guesswork for connections more
complicated than &quot;I was hungry and thinking about cheese, so
then I ate some cheese&quot;. Additionally, take note of any
interesting <EM>absences</EM>. If something generally considered sad
has happened to you, and you can detect no sadness in your affect or

reads about an experiment in which the subjects receive phone calls
at random times and must tell researchers how happy they feel.
Apparently the experiment turned up some really suboptimal patterns
of behavior, and Dot's curious about what she'd learn that she could
use to improve her life. She gets a friend to arrange delayed text
messages to be sent to her phone at intervals supplied by a random
number generator, and promises herself that she'll note what she's
doing, thinking, and feeling at the moment she receives the text. She
soon finds that she doesn't enjoy watching TV as much as she thinks
she does; that it's probably worth the time to cook dinner rather
than heating up something in the microwave because it's considerably
tastier; that she can't really stand her cubicle neighbor; and that
she thinks about her ex more than she'd have ever admitted. These
thoughts were usually too fleeting to turn into actions; if she tried
to remember them hours later, they'd be folded into some large story
in which these momentary emotions were secondary. But treating them
as notable data points to be taken into account gives them staying
power. Dot starts keeping the TV remote under the book she's reading
to remind herself what entertainment is more fulfilling. She buys
fewer frozen meals and makes sure she's stocked up on staple
ingredients. She agrees to swap cubicles with a co-worker down the
hall. There's not all that much she can do about the ex, but at least
when her friends ask her if everything's okay between them, she can
answer more accurately.</SPAN></EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

hard and you are complicated. You can't meditate on yourself for ten

because some effects don't work over the short term. If your affect
varies with the seasons, or with major life events, then you'll need
to keep up the first phase of work through a full year or a major
life event, and it turns out those don't happen every alternate

going to happen. Therefore, some of your data will have to come from

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">When you

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> How did you feel about the

<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="text-align: justify">George is trying to figure
out who he is. He's trying really hard. But when he tries to explain
his behaviors and thoughts in terms of larger patterns that could
answer the question, they inevitably sound suspiciously revisionist
and self-serving, like he's conveniently forgetting some parts and
artificially inflating others. He thinks he's generous, fun at
parties, a great family man, loyal, easygoing. George decides that
what he needs to do is catch what he's thinking at the moment he's
thinking it, honestly and irrevocably, so he'll have an uncorrupted
data set to work with. He fires up a word processor and starts
typing, stream of consciousness. For a few paragraphs, it's mostly
&quot;here I am, writing what I think&quot; and &quot;this is kind of
dumb, I wonder if anything will come of it&quot;, but eventually that
gets old, and content starts to come out. Soon George has a few
minutes of inner monologue written down. He writes the congratulatory
things he thinks about himself, but also notes in parentheses the
times he's acted contrary to these nice patterns (he took three
helpings of cake that one time when there were fewer slices than
guests, he spent half of the office celebration on his cellphone
instead of participating, he missed his daughter's last birthday, he
dropped a friend over a sports rivalry, he blew up when a co-worker
reminded him one too many times to finish that spreadsheet). George
writes the bad habits and vices he demonstrates, too. Most
importantly, he resists the urge to hit backspace, although he freely
contradicts himself if there's something he wants to correct. Then he
saves the document, squirrels it away in a folder, and waits a week.
The following Tuesday, he goes over it like a stranger had written it

to do.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>One problem with introspection is that the
conclusions you draw about your thoughts are themselves thoughts.
Thoughts, of course, can change or disappear before you can extract
information about yourself from them. If a flash of unreasonable
anger crosses my mind, this might stick around long enough to make me
lash out, but then vanish before I discover how unreasonable it was.
If thoughts weren't slippery like this, luminosity wouldn't be much
of a project. So of course, if you're serious about luminosity, you
need a way to pin down your thoughts into a concrete format that will
hold still.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>You have to pry your thoughts out of your brain.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Writing is the obvious way to do this - for me,
anyway. You don't have to publicize what you extract, so it doesn't
have to be aesthetic or skillful, just serviceable for your own
reference. The key is to get it down in a form that you can look at
without having to continue to introspect. Whether this means
sketching or scribing or singing, dump your brain out into the
environment and have a peek. It's easy to fool yourself into thinking
that a given idea makes sense; it's harder to fool someone else.
Writing down an idea automatically engages the mechanisms we use to
communicate to others, helping you hold your self-analysis to a
higher standard.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>To turn your thoughts into non-thoughts, use labels
to represent them. Put them in reference classes, so that you can
notice when the same quale, habit of inference, or thread of
cognition repeats. That way, you can detect patterns: &quot;Hey, the
last time I felt like this, I said something I really regretted; I'd
better watch it.&quot; If you can tell when something has happened
twice, you can tell when it hasn't – and <EM>new </EM>moods or
dispositions are potentially very important. They mean that you or
something around you has changed, and that could be a valuable
resource or a tricky hazard.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Your labels can map onto traditional terms or not -
if you want to call the feeling of having just dropped your ice cream
on the sidewalk &quot;blortrath&quot;, no one will stop you. (It can
be useful, later when you're trying to share your conclusions about
yourself with others, to have a vocabulary of emotion that overlaps
significantly with theirs; but you can always set up an
idiolect-to-dialect dictionary later.) I do recommend identifying
labeled items as being more or less similar to each other (e.g.
annoyance is more like fury than it is like glee) and having a way to
account for that in your symbolism. Similarities like that will make
it more obvious how you can generalize strategies from one thing to
another.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Especially if you don't think in words, you might
find it challenging to turn your thoughts into something in the world
that represents them. Maybe, for instance, you think in pictures but
aren't at all good at drawing. This is one of the steps in luminosity
that I think is potentially dispensable, so if you honestly cannot
think of any way to jot down the dance of your mind for later
inspection, you can just work on thinking very carefully such that if
something were to be out of place the next time you came back to your
thought, you'd notice it. I do recommend spending at least five to
ten minutes trying to write, diagram, draw, mutter, or
interpretive-dance your mental activity before you give it up as
untenable for you, however.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Once you have produced a visible or audible
translation of your thoughts, <EM>analy</EM><EM>z</EM><EM>e it the
way you would if someone else had written it </EM>(except inasmuch as
it's in a code that's uniquely understandable to you and you
shouldn't pretend to do cryptanalysis on it). What would you think of
the person described if you didn't know anything else? How would you
explain these thoughts? What threads of reasoning seem to run in the
background from one belief to another, or from a perception to a
belief, or from a desire to an intention? What do you expect this
person to do next? What's your next best guess after that? And: what
more do you want to know? If you met the person described, how could
you satisfy your curiosity without relying on the bias-laden answer
you'd get in response to a verbal inquiry? Try it now - in a comment
under this post, if you like: note what you're thinking, as much of
it as you can grab and get down. Turn on the anti-kibitzer and
pretend someone else said it: what must be going on in the mind
behind this writing?</P>

as promised in <A HREF="#2.You Are Likely To Be Eaten By A Grue|outline">post
two</A>, luminosity can let you determine what you'd like to change
as well as what's already present.</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">But what to
change?</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">An important
step in the luminosity project is to sort your thoughts and feelings
not only by type, <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1y0/the_abcs_of_luminosity/">correlation</A>,
strength, etc, but also by endorsement. You endorse those thoughts
that you like, find representative of your favorite traits, prefer to
see carried into action, and wish to keep intact (at least for the
duration of their useful lives). By contrast, you repudiate those
thoughts that you dislike, consider indicative of negative
characteristics, want to keep inefficacious, and desire to modify or
be rid of entirely.</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Deciding which
is which might not be trivial. You might need to sift through several
orders of desire before finally figuring out whether you <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/fv/wanting_to_want/">want
to want</A> cake, or like liking sleep, or prefer your preference for
preferentism. A good place to start is with your macro-level goals
and theoretical commitments (e.g., when this preference is
efficacious, does it serve your Life Purpose™, directly or
indirectly? if you have firm metaethical notions of right and wrong,
is this tendency you have uncovered in yourself one that impels you
to do right things?).</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">As a second
pass, you can work with the information you collected when you
correlated your ABC's. How does an evaluated desire makes you feel
when satisfied or unsatisfied? Does it cripple you when unsatisfied
or improve your performance when satisfied? Are you reliably in a
position to satisfy it? If you can't typically satisfy it, would it
be easier to change the desire or to change the circumstances that
prevent its satisfaction? However, this is a second step. You need to
know what affect and behavior are preferable to you before you can
judge desires (and other mental activity) relative to what they yield
in those departments, and judging affect and behavior is itself an
exercise in endorsement and repudiation.</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Knowing what
you like and don't like about your mind is a fine thing. Once you
have that information, you can put it to direct use immediately. I
find it useful to tag many of my expressions of emotion with the
words &quot;endorsed&quot; or &quot;non-endorsed&quot;. That way, the
people around me can use that categorization rather than having to
either assume I approve of everything I feel, or layer their own
projections of endorsement on top of me. Either would be unreliable
and cause people to have poor models of me. I have not yet managed to
excise my every unwanted trait, and my patterns of endorsement do not
typically map on to the ones that the people around me have or expect
me to have.</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Additionally,
once you know what you like and don't like about your mind, you can
begin to make progress in increasing the ratio of liked to unliked
characteristics. People often make haphazard lurches towards trying
to be &quot;better people&quot;, but when &quot;better&quot; means
&quot;lines up more closely with vaguely defined commonsense
intuitions about morality&quot;, this is not the sort of goal we're
at all good at pursuing. Specific projects like being generous or
more mindful are a step closer, but the greatest marginal benefit in
self-revision comes of figuring out what comes in advance of behaving
in a non-endorsed way and heading it off at the pass. (More on this
in &quot;<A HREF="#9.Lampshading|outline">Lampshading</A>&quot;.) The
odds are low that your brain's patterns align closely with
conventional virtues well enough for them to be useful targets. It's
a better plan to identify what's already present, then endorse or
repudiate these pre-sliced thoughts and work on them as they appear
instead of sweeping together an unnatural category.</SPAN></EM></P>

what Prof. So-and-So recommends; &quot;Academic&quot;, who wants to
do whatever will make Billy's résumé more impressive to future
readers; and &quot;Fear of Spiders&quot;, which would happily go
nearly anywhere but the home of the Sydney funnel-web and is probably
responsible for Billy's spooky dreams. When these voices have a
chance to compete with each other, they expose questionable
motivations: for instance, Academic determines that Prof. So-and-So
only recommends staying at Billy's home institution because Billy is
her research assistant, not because it would further Billy's
intellectual growth, which reduces the comparative power of Obedience
to Advisor. Adventurer renders Fear of Spiders irrelevant by pointing
out that the black widow is native to the United States. Eventually,
Academic and Adventurer, in coalition, beat out Clingyness (whom
Billy is not strongly inclined to identify with), and Billy buys the
ticket to Down Under.</SPAN></EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">When grappling
with the complex web of traits and patterns that is you, you are
reasonably likely to find yourself <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1mu/sorting_out_sticky_brains/">less
than completely uniform</A>. You might have several competing
perspectives, possess the ability to code-switch between different
<A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1ty/mental_crystallography/">styles
of thought</A>, or even believe outright contradictions. It's bound
to make it harder to think about yourself when you find this kind of
convolution.</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Unfortunately,
we don't have the vocabulary or even the mental architecture to
easily think of or describe ourselves (nor other people) as
containing such multitudes. The closest we come in typical
conversation more resembles descriptions of superficial, vague
ambivalence (&quot;I'm sorta happy about it, but kind of sad at the
same time! Weird!&quot;) than the sort of deep-level muddle and
conflict that can occupy a brain. The models of the human psyche that
have come closest to approximating this mess are what I call
&quot;multi-agent models.&quot; (Note: I have no idea how what I am
about to describe interacts with actual psychiatric conditions
involving multiple personalities, voices in one's head, or other
potentially similar-sounding phenomena. I describe multi-agent models
as employed by psychiatrically singular persons.)<BR><BR>Multi-agent
models have been around for a long time: in Plato's Republic, he
talks about appetite (itself imperfectly self-consistent), spirit,
and reason, forming a tripartite soul. He discusses their functions
as though each has its own agency and could perceive, desire, plan,
and act given the chance (plus the possibility of one forcing down
the other two to rule the soul unopposed). Not too far off in
structure is the Freudian id/superego/ego model. The notion of the
multi-agent self even <A HREF="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel">appears
in fiction</A> (warning: TV Tropes). It appears to be a surprisingly
prevalent and natural method for conceptualizing the complicated mind
of the average human being. Of course, talking about it as something
to do rather than as a way to push your psychological theories or
your notion of the ideal city structure or a dramatization of a moral
conflict makes you sound like an insane person. Bear with me - I have
data on the usefulness of the practice from more than one outside
source.</SPAN></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">There is no
reason to limit yourself to traditional multi-agent models endorsed
by dead philosophers, psychologists, or cartoonists if you find you
break down more naturally along some other arrangement. You can have
two of you, or five, or twelve. (More than you can keep track of and
differentiate is not a recommended strategy - if you're very tempted
to go with this many it may be a sign of something </SPAN></EM><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">unhealthy</SPAN></EM><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
going on. If a group of them form a reliable coalition it may be best
to fold them back into each other and call them one sub-agent, not
several.) Stick with a core ensemble or encourage brief cameos of
peripheral aspects. Name them descriptively or after structures of
the brain or for the colors of the rainbow, as long as you can tell
them apart. Talk to yourselves <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1za/the_spotlight/">aloud
or in writing</A>, or just think through the interaction if you think
you'll get enough out of it that way. Some examples of things that

</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">By priors picked up
from descriptions of various people trying this, you're reasonably
likely to identify one of your sub-agents as &quot;<A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/v4/which_parts_are_me/">you</A>.&quot;
In fact, one sub-agent may be </SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">solely
</SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">identified as &quot;you&quot;
- it's very hard to shake the monolithic observer experience. This is
fine, especially if the &quot;you&quot; sub-agent is the one that
<A HREF="#7.Highlights and Shadows|outline">endorses or repudiates</A>,
but don't let the endorsement and repudiation get out of hand during
multi-agent exercises. You have to deal with all of your sub-agents,
not just the one(s) you like best, and sub-agents have been known to
exhibit manipulative and even vengeful behaviors once given voice -
i.e. if you represent your desire for cake as a sub-agent, and you
have been thwarting your desire for cake for years, you might find
that Desire For Cake is pissed off at Self-Restraint and says mean
things thereunto. It will not placate Desire For Cake for you to
throw in endorsement behind Self-Restraint while Desire For Cake is
just trying to talk to you about your desperate yen for tiramisu.
Until and unless you understand Desire For Cake well enough to
surgically remove it, you need to work with it. Opposing it directly
and with normative censure will be likely to make it angry and more
devious in causing you to eat cake.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="font-style: normal">A few miscellaneous notes
on sub-agents:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Your sub-agents may
surprise you far more than you expect to be surprised by... well...
yourself, which is part of what makes this exercise so useful. If you
consciously steer the entire dialogue you will not get as much out of
it - then you're just writing self-insert </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">fan

your brain, not actually learning about it.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="font-style: normal">Not all of your
sub-agents will be &quot;interested&quot; in every problem, and
therefore won't have much of relevance to say at all times. (Desire
For Cake probably couldn't care less how you act on your date next
week until it's time to order dessert.)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="font-style: normal">Your sub-agents should
not outright lie to each other (&quot;should&quot; in the predictive,
not normative, sense - let me know if it turns out yours do), but
they may threaten, negotiate, hide, and be genuinely ignorant about
themselves.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="text-align: justify"><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Eva
bursts into tears whenever she has a hard problem to deal with, like
a stressful project at work or above-average levels of social drama
amongst her friends. This is, of course, completely unproductive - in
fact, in the case of drama, it worsens things - and Eva wants to stop
it. First, she has to figure out why it happens. Are the tears caused
</SPAN></EM><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">by sadness</SPAN></EM><EM><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">?
It turns out not - she can be brought to tears even by things that
don't make her sad. The latest project from work was exciting and a
great opportunity and it still made her cry. After a little work
sorting through lists of things that make her cry, Eva concludes that
it's linked to how much pressure she feels to solve the problem: for
instance, if she's part of a team that's assigned a project, she's
less likely to react this way than if she's operating solo, and if
her friends embroiled in drama turn to her for help, she'll wind up
tearful more often than if she's just a spectator with no special
responsibility. Now she needs to set herself up not to cry. She
decides to do this by making sure she has social support in her
endeavors: if the boss gives her an assignment, she says to the next
employee over, &quot;I should be able to handle this, but if I need
help, can I count on you?&quot; That way, she can think of the task
as something that isn't entirely on her. When next social drama rears
its head, Eva reconceptualizes her part in the solution as finding
and voicing the group's existing consensus, rather than personally
creating a novel way to make everything better. While this new
approach reduces the incidence of stress tears, it doesn't
disassemble the underlying architecture that causes the tendency in
the first place. That's more complicated to address: Eva spends some
time thinking about why responsibility is such an emotional thing for
her, and looks for ways to duplicate the sense of support she feels
when she has help in situations where she doesn't. Eventually, it is
not much of a risk that Eva will cry if presented with a problem to
solve.</SPAN></EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

can falsify that model which says you'll yell by not yelling:
clearly, if you do not yell at her, then you cannot be accurately
described by any model that predicts that you'll yell. By refraining
from yelling you push the nearest accurate model towards something
like &quot;may yell if not careful to think before speaking&quot; or

sequence</A>. In <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1za/the_spotlight/1t8q">this
comment</A>, I mentioned that I have raised my happiness set point
(among other things), and this declaration was met with some
interest. Some of the details are lost to memory, but below, I
reconstruct for your analysis what I can of the process. It contains
lots of gooey self-disclosure; skip if that's not your thing.</EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In summary: I decided that I had to and wanted to
become happier; I re-labeled my moods and approached their management
accordingly; and I consistently treated my mood maintenance and its
support behaviors (including discovering new techniques) as immensely
important. The steps in more detail:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><A NAME="more9"></A>1.<EM> I came to understand the
</EM><EM><STRONG>necessity </STRONG></EM><EM>of becoming happier.</EM>
Being unhappy was not just unpleasant. It was <EM>dangerous</EM>: I
had a history of suicidal ideation. This hadn't resulted in actual
attempts at killing myself, largely because I attached hopes for
improvement to concrete external milestones (various academic
progressions) and therefore imagined myself a magical healing when I
got the next diploma (the next one, the next one.) Once I noticed I
was doing that, it was unsustainable. If I wanted to live, I had to
find a safe emotional place on which to stand. It had to be my top
priority. This required several sub-projects:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> I had to eliminate the baggage
	that told me it was <EM>appropriate </EM>or <EM>accurate </EM>to
	feel bad most of the time. I endorse my ability to react emotionally
	to my environment; but this should be acute, not chronic. Reacting
	emotionally is about feeling worse when things <EM>get </EM>worse,
	not feeling bad when things are bad for months or years on end.
	(Especially not when feeling bad reduces the ability to make things
	less bad.) Further, having a lower set point did not affect my
	emotional <EM>range </EM>except to shrink it; it reduced the
	possible impact of real grief, and wasn't compatible with the &quot;react
	emotionally&quot; plan. The low set point also compromised my
	ability to react emotionally to <EM>positive </EM>input, because it
	was attached to a systematic discounting of such positivity.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> I had to eliminate the baggage
	that told me it was not possible to <EM>cognitively </EM>change my
	mood. Moods correspond to thoughts, and while it can be hard to
	<EM>avoid </EM>thinking about things, I can decide <EM>to </EM>think
	about whatever I want. A decade of assorted antidepressants had
	wrought no discernible change on my affect, which constituted strong
	evidence that chemicals were not my problem. And it was easy to see
	that my mood varied on a small scale with things under my complete
	or partial control, like sleep, diet, and activity. It did not seem
	outrageous that long-term, large-scale interventions could have
	similar effects on my overall mood.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> I had to decide, and act on the
	decision, that my happiness was important and worth my time and
	attention. I had to pay attention, and note what helped and what
	hurt. I had to put increasing the helping factors and decreasing the
	hurting factors at the top of my list whenever it was remotely
	feasible, and relax my standards around &quot;remote feasibility&quot;
	to prevent self-sabotage. And I had to commit to abandoning
	counterproductive projects or interactions, at least until I'd
	developed the stability to deal with the emotions they generated
	without suffering permanent setbacks.</P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>2. <EM>I </EM><EM><STRONG>re-labeled </STRONG></EM><EM>my
moods, so that identifying them in the moment prompted the right
actions.</EM> When a given point on the unhappy-happy spectrum -
let's call it &quot;2&quot; on a scale of 1 to 10 - was labeled
&quot;normal&quot; or &quot;set point&quot;, then when I was feeling
&quot;2&quot;, I didn't assume that meant anything; that was the
default state. That left me feeling &quot;2&quot; a lot of the time,
and when things went wrong, I dipped lower, and I waited for things
outside of myself to go right before I went higher. The problem was
that &quot;2&quot; was not a good place to be spending most of my
time.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> I had to label the old set-point
	as subnormal, a <EM>problem state </EM>that generated a need for
	immediate action from me to <EM>fix </EM>it. It was like telling
	myself that, unbeknownst to me, my left foot was in constant pain
	and needed medicine at once: kind of hard to swallow, given that my
	left foot always felt pretty much the same unless I'd just stubbed a
	toe or received a massage. But eventually, I attached <EM>urgency </EM>to
	the old set point. It was not <EM>just </EM>how things were
	normally; it was a sign that something was <EM>wrong.</EM></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> I had to make sure that I had
	many accessible, cheap excuses to cheer up, so I didn't ever fall
	into the trap of &quot;just this once&quot; leaving myself at a &quot;2&quot;
	state instead of acting. I designated a favorite pair of socks and
	wore them whenever I woke up on the wrong side of the bed; I took up
	the habit of saving every picture of a cute animal I found on the
	Internet so I could leaf through the collection whenever I wanted; I
	threw myself into developing the skill of making friends <EM>on
	purpose </EM>so I'd have lots and if I happened to log onto my IM
	client, someone would be there who would talk to me; I became very
	acquisitive of inexpensive goods like music and interesting
	websites. When one of these interventions failed to work, I forced
	myself to try something else, rather than falling into the self-talk
	disaster of &quot;well, that didn't help; I guess something must
	really be wrong and I should feel like this until it goes away by
	itself.&quot; I also harnessed my tendency to feel better after a
	night's sleep - if I felt suboptimal close to bedtime, I'd turn in
	early and reasonably expect to wake up improved.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> I stopped tolerating the minor
	injuries to my affect that I identified as most consistent and,
	therefore, most likely to contribute to my poor set point. For
	instance, I noticed that I always slept better when I didn't go to
	bed expecting to awaken to the sound of an alarm, so I aggressively
	rearranged my schedule to give me morning leeway, and found alarm
	software that would wake me more gently when an early start was
	absolutely necessary. I identified people with whom interaction was
	frustrating and draining, and I limited interaction with them both
	by reducing opportunities to start, and by dropping my standards for
	abandoning the exchange midway through so I could leave before
	things got very bad. I practiced, in general, &quot;writing things
	off&quot; and rehearsed internal monologues about how I no longer
	needed to worry about [thing X]. (&quot;I cannot control the speed
	of the bus. I caught it, and it will get there when it gets there.
	There is no point in further fretting about being late until I'm
	moving under my own power again - so I'll stop. To manage my strong,
	intrusive desire to be on time, I will start thinking about how to
	choose an efficient path to walk once I get off the bus.&quot;)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> I labeled my new desired set
	point - a safe spot on the spectrum, call it &quot;5&quot;, which
	was ambitious yet felt attainable - as &quot;normal&quot;. When
	asked how I was in this state, I consciously chose to say that I was
	&quot;fine&quot; or &quot;okay&quot; instead of something more
	enthusiastic, like &quot;great&quot;, that I might have said before
	- the energy I felt at &quot;5&quot; was no longer to be considered
	<EM>extra</EM>. Similarly, these were not suitable occasions to do
	displeasing things. I didn't have happiness to burn at &quot;5&quot;
	- I waited until I was even better before I relaxed my emotional
	avarice. Instead, &quot;5&quot; was a good place from which to
	undertake more expensive entertainments that offered net
	improvement. (More difficult than choosing a specific pair of socks
	to wear is starting a D&amp;D game, or walking around and exploring
	a new location, or working on a piece of artwork or fiction; the lag
	time and effort makes them poor &quot;cheer up&quot; activities, but
	excellent ways to get from &quot;5&quot; to &quot;6&quot; or &quot;7&quot;.)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> I made a point of noting
	non-sadness deficiencies in my status like boredom, hunger,
	tiredness, or annoyance. These weren't directly related to the set
	point I was trying to affect, but they could exacerbate a bad
	influence or limit the power of a good one. Additionally, at the
	level of luminosity I then had to work with, they could also mask
	moods that were actually sadness, in much the same way that
	sometimes one can feel hungry when in fact just thirsty.</P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>3. <EM>I treated my own mood as </EM><EM><STRONG>manageable</STRONG></EM><EM>.
</EM>Thinking of it as a thing that attacked me with no rhyme or
reason - treating a bout of depression like a cold - didn't just cost
me the opportunity to fight it, but also made the entire situation
seem more out-of-control and hopeless. I was wary of learned
helplessness; I decided that it would be best to interpret my
historically static set point as an indication that I hadn't hit on
the right techniques yet, not as an indication that it was inviolable
and everlasting. Additionally, the fact that I didn't know how to fix
it yet meant that if it was going to be my top priority, I had to
treat the value of information as very high; it was worth
experimenting, and I didn't have to wait for surety before I gave
something a shot.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> Even if I determined that my mood
	reacted to my environment in some way, that only removed my power
	over it one step: I could control my environment to a considerable
	degree, and with a strong enough reason to do so, I committed to
	enacting that power. (This sometimes has had unexpected and dramatic
	consequences. For example, once I determined that grad school was no
	longer compatible with my happiness, I dropped out as soon as I had
	something promising to switch to - mid semester - and moved across
	the country. To excellent effect, I might add.)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> Even if I have a lot on my plate,
	being happier will help me do it. It's like sleep: it's easy to keep
	staying up and staying up, because sleep just seems so <EM>unproductive</EM>,
	and you can get <EM>some </EM>work done however tired you are. But
	over the long term, getting to sleep at a sane hour every day will
	let you accomplish more; and so with maintaining a good affect
	consistently. Mood maintenance is typically not the most <EM>immediately
	productive </EM>thing I could be doing, but treating it as my top
	priority save in dire emergency has let me be more effective than I
	was before.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> I had to be willing to expend
	resources on my project. This involved working around some neuroses,
	like my unwillingness to spend money, and overcoming some background
	reluctance to try new things. Also, I had to allow myself to be
	somewhat subject to my whims. I still don't know what makes the mood
	to, say, do artwork strike me, but when it strikes, I have to do art
	or lose the inclination. Efficacious inclinations to do fun things
	are precious to me, and so whenever possible, I don't restrain them
	- even though this costs time and occludes other activities.</P>

Suite of Pragmatic Considerations In Favor of Niceness</A></EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM>In <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1za/the_spotlight/1t8q">this
comment</A>, I mentioned that I can like people on purpose. At the
behest of the recipients of my presentation on how to do so, I've
written up in post form my tips on the subject. I have not included,
and will not include, any specific real-life examples (everything
below is made up), because I am concerned that people who I like on
purpose will be upset to find that this is the case, in spite of the
fact that the liking (once generated) is entirely sincere. If anyone
would find more concreteness helpful, I'm willing to come up with
<A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2a5/on_enjoying_disagreeable_company/2272">brief
fictional stories</A> to cover this gap.</EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It is useful to like people. For one thing, if you
have to be around them, liking them makes this far more pleasant. For
another, well, they can often <EM>tell</EM>, and if they know you to
like them this will often be instrumentally useful to you. As such,
it's very handy to be able to like someone you want to like
deliberately when it doesn't happen by itself. There are three basic
components to liking someone on purpose. First, reduce salience of
the disliked traits by separating, recasting, and downplaying them;
second, increase salience of positive traits by identifying,
investigating, and admiring them; and third, behave in such a way as
to reap consistency effects.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><STRONG>1. Reduce salience of disliked traits.</STRONG></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Identify the traits you don't like about the person
- this might be a handful of irksome habits or a list as long as your
arm of deep character flaws, but make sure you know what they are.
Notice that however immense a set of characteristics you generate,
it's not the entire person. (&quot;Everything!!!!&quot; is not an
acceptable entry in this step.) No person can be fully described by a
list of things you have noticed about them. Note, accordingly, that
you dislike <EM>these things </EM>about the person; but that this
does not logically entail disliking <EM>the person</EM>. Put the list
in a &quot;box&quot; – <EM>separate </EM>from how you will
eventually evaluate the person.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>When the person exhibits a characteristic, habit, or
tendency you have on your list (or, probably just to aggravate you,
turns out to have a new one), be on your guard immediately for the
<A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hz/correspondence_bias/">fundamental
attribution error</A>. It is especially insidious when you already
dislike the person, and so it's important to compensate consciously
and directly for its influence. Elevate to conscious thought an
&quot;attribution story,&quot; in which you consider a <EM>circumstance</EM>-
not a character trait - which would explain this most recent example
of bad behavior.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
This should be the most likely story you can come up with that
doesn't resort to grumbling about how dreadful the person is - that
is, don't resort to &quot;Well, maybe he was brainwashed by Martians,
but sheesh, how likely is <EM>that?</EM>&quot; Better would be &quot;I
know she was up late last night, and she does look a bit tired,&quot;
or &quot;Maybe that three-hour phone call he ended just now was about
something terribly stressful.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Reach a little farther if you don't have this kind
of information - &quot;I'd probably act that way if I were coming
down with a cold; I wonder if she's sick?&quot; is an acceptable
speculation even absent the least sniffle. If you can, it's also a
good idea to <EM>ask </EM>(earnestly, curiously, respectfully,
kindly! not accusatively, rudely, intrusively, belligerently!) why
the person did whatever they did. Rest assured that if their psyche
is fairly normal, an explanation exists in their minds that doesn't
boil down to &quot;I'm a lousy excuse for a person who intrinsically
does evil things just because it is my nature.&quot; (Note, however,
that not everyone can produce verbal self-justifications on demand.)
Whether you believe them or not, make sure you are aware of at least
one circumstance-based explanation for what they did.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Notice which situations elicit more of the disliked
behaviors than others. Everybody has situations that bring out the
worst in them, and when the worst is already getting on your nerves,
you should avoid as much as possible letting any extra bubble to the
surface. If you have influence of any kind over which roles this
person plays in your life (or in general), confine them to those in
which their worst habits are irrelevant, mitigated, or local
advantages of some kind. Do not ask for a ride to the airport from
someone who terrifies you with their speeding; don't propose
splitting dessert with someone whose selfishness drives you up the
wall; don't assign the procrastinator an urgent task. Do ask the
speeder to make a quick run to the bank before it closes while you're
(ever so inconveniently) stuck at home; do give the selfish person
tasks where they work on commission; do give the procrastinator
things to do that they'll interpret as ways to put off their other
work.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><STRONG>2. Increase salience of positive traits.</STRONG></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Don't look at me like that. <EM>There is something</EM>.
It's okay to grasp at straws a little to start. You do not have to
wait to like someone until you discover the millions of dollars they
donate to mitigating existential risk or learn that their pseudonym
is the name of your favorite musician. You can like their cool
haircut, or the way they phrased that one sentence the other week, or
even their shoes. You can appreciate that they've undergone more
hardship than you (if they have, but be generous in interpreting
&quot;more&quot; when comparing incommensurate difficulties) - even
if you don't think they've handled it that well, well, it was hard.
You can acknowledge that they are better than you, or than baseline,
or than any one person who you already like, at some skill or in some
sphere of achievement. You can think they did a good job of picking
out their furniture, or loan them halo effect from a relative or
friend of theirs who you think is okay. There is <EM>something.</EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Learn more about the likable things you have
discovered. &quot;Catch them in the act&quot; of showing off one of
these fine qualities. As a corollary to the bit above about not
putting them in roles that bring out their worst, try to put them in
situations where they're at their best. Set them up to succeed, both
absolutely and in your eyes. Speak to any available mutual friends
about what more there is to like - learn how the person makes
friends, what attracts people to them, what people get out of
associating with them. Solicit stories about the excellent deeds of
the target person. Collect material like you're a biographer
terrified of being sued for libel and dreading coming in under page
count: you need to know all the nice things there are to know.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It is absolutely essential throughout this process
to cultivate <EM>admiration, not jealousy</EM>. Jealousy and
resentment are absolutely counterproductive, while admiration and
respect - however grudging - are steps in the right direction.
Additionally, you are trying to <EM>use </EM>these features of the
person. It will not further your goals if you discount their
importance in the grand scheme of things. Do not think, &quot;She has
such pretty hair, why does she get such pretty hair when she doesn't
deserve it since she's such an awful person? Grrr!&quot; Instead,
&quot;She has such pretty hair. It's gorgeous to look at and that
makes her nice to have around. I wonder if she has time to teach me
how to do my hair like that.&quot; Or instead of: &quot;Sure, he can
speak Latin, but what the hell use is Latin? Does he think we're
going to be invaded by legionaries and need him to be a diplomat?&quot;
it would be more useful towards the project of liking to think, &quot;Most
people don't have the patience and dedication to learn any second
language, and it only makes it harder to pick one where there aren't
native speakers available to help teach the finer points. I bet a lot
of effort went into this.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><STRONG>3. Reap consistency effects.</STRONG></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Take care to be kind and considerate to the person.
The odds are pretty good that there is something they don't like
about <EM>you </EM>(rubbing someone the wrong way is more often
bidirectional than not). If you can figure out what it is, and do
less of it - at least around them - you will collect cognitive
dissonance that you can use to nudge yourself to like the person. I
mean, otherwise, why would you go to the trouble of not tapping your
fingers around them, or making sure to pronounce their complicated
name correctly, or remembering what they're allergic to so you can
avoid bringing in food suitable for everyone but them? That's the
sort of thing you do when you care how they feel, and if you care how
they feel, you must like them at least a little. (Note failure mode:
if you discover that something you do annoys them, and you respond
with resentment that they have such an unreasonable preference about
such a deeply held part of your identity and how dare they!, you're
doing it wrong. The point isn't to completely make yourself over to
be their ideal friend. You don't have to do everything. But do
<EM>something</EM>.)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Seek to spend time around the person. This should
drop pretty naturally out of the above steps: you need to acquire all
this information from <EM>somewhere, </EM>after all. Seek their
opinions on things, especially their areas of expertise and favorite
topics; make small talk; ask after their projects, their interests,
their loved ones; choose to hang out in rooms they occupy even if you
never interact. (Note failure mode: Don't do this if you can feel
yourself hating them more every minute you spend together or if you
find it stressful enough to inhibit the above mental exercises. It is
better to do more work on liking them from a distance if you are at
this stage, then later move on to seeking to spend time with them.
Also, if you annoy them, don't do anything that could be
characterized as pestering them or following them around.)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Try to learn something from the person - by example,
if they aren't interested in teaching you, or directly, if they are.
It is possible to learn even from people who don't have significantly
better skills than you. If they tell stories about things they've
done, you can learn from their mistakes; if they are worse than you
at a skill but use an approach to it that you haven't tried, you can
learn how to use it; if nothing else, they know things about
<EM>themselves</EM>, and that information is highly useful for the
project of liking them, as discussed above. Put what you know about
them into the context of their own perspective.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><STRONG>Note general failure mode:</STRONG></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It would be fairly easy, using facsimiles of the
strategy above, to develop smugness, self-righteousness, arrogance,
and other unseemly attitudes. <EM>Beware </EM>if your inner monologue
begins to sound something like &quot;He's gone and broken the sink
again, but I'm too good and tolerant to be angry. It wouldn't do any
good to express my displeasure - after all, he can't take criticism,
not that I judge him for this, of course. I'll be sure to put a note
on the faucet and call the plumber to cover for his failure to do so,
rather than nagging him to do it, as I know he'd fly off the handle
if I reminded him - it's just not everyone's gift to accept such
things, as it is mine, and as I am doing, right now, with him, by not
being upset...&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This monologuer does not <EM>like </EM>the
sink-breaker. This monologuer holds him in contempt, and thinks very
highly of herself for keeping this contempt ostensibly private
(although it's entirely possible that he can tell anyway). She
tolerates his company because it would be beneath her not to; she
doesn't enjoy having him around because she realizes that he has
useful insights on relevant topics or even because he's decorative in
some way. <EM>If you don't wind up really, genuinely, sincerely
liking the person you set out to like, you are doing it wrong. This
is not a credit to your high-mindedness, and thinking it is will not
help you win.</EM></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><EM>It has come to my attention that the contents of
the luminosity<A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1xh/living_luminously/">
sequence</A>were too abstract, to the point where explicitly
fictional stories illustrating the use of the concepts would be
helpful. Accordingly, there follow some such stories.</EM></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><STRONG>1. Words </STRONG>(an idea from <A HREF="#3.Let There Be Light|outline">Let
There Be Light</A>, in which I advise harvesting priors about
yourself from outside feedback)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Maria likes compliments. She <EM>loves </EM>compliments.
And when she doesn't get enough of them to suit her, she starts
fishing, asking plaintive questions, making doe eyes to draw them
out. It's starting to annoy people. Lately, instead of compliments,
she's getting barbs and criticism and snappish remarks. It hurts -
and it seems to hurt her more than it hurts others when they hear
similar things. Maria wants to know what it is about her that would
explain all of this. So she starts taking personality tests and
looking for different styles of maintaining and thinking about
relationships, looking for something that describes her. Eventually,
she runs into a concept called &quot;love languages&quot; and
realizes at once that she's a &quot;words&quot; person. Her friends
aren't trying to hurt her - they don't realize how much she thrives
on compliments, or how deeply insults can cut when they're dealing
with someone who transmits affection verbally. Armed with this
concept, she has a lens through which to interpret patterns of her
own behavior; she also has a way to explain herself to her loved ones
and get the wordy boosts she needs.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><STRONG>2. Widgets </STRONG>(an idea from The<A HREF="#4.The ABC's of Luminosity|outline">
ABC's of Luminosity</A>, in which I explain the value of correlating
affect, behavior, and circumstance)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><A NAME="more"></A>Tony's performance at work is
suffering. Not every day, but most days, he's too drained and
distracted to perform the tasks that go into making widgets. He's in
serious danger of falling behind his widget quota and needs to figure
out why. Having just read a fascinating and brilliantly written post
on Less Wrong about luminosity, he decides to keep track of where he
is and what he's doing when he does and doesn't feel the drainedness.
After a week, he's got a fairly robust correlation: he feels worst on
days when he doesn't eat breakfast, which reliably occurs when he's
stayed up too late, hit the snooze button four times, and had to dash
out the door. Awkwardly enough, having been distracted all day tends
to make him work more slowly at making widgets, which makes him less
physically exhausted by the time he gets home and enables him to stay
up later. To deal with that, he starts going for long runs on days
when his work hasn't been very tiring, and pops melatonin. He easily
drops off to sleep when his head hits the pillow at a reasonable
hour, gets sounder sleep, scarfs down a bowl of Cheerios, and arrives
at the widget factory energized and focused.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><STRONG>3. Text </STRONG>(an idea from <A HREF="#5.Lights, Camera, Action!|outline">Lights,
Camera, Action!</A>, in which I advocate aggressive and frequent
introspection to collect as much data as possible)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Dot reads about an experiment in which the subjects
receive phone calls at random times and must tell researchers how
happy they feel. Apparently the experiment turned up some really
suboptimal patterns of behavior, and Dot's curious about what she'd
learn that she could use to improve her life. She gets a friend to
arrange delayed text messages to be sent to her phone at intervals
supplied by a random number generator, and promises herself that
she'll note what she's doing, thinking, and feeling at the moment she
receives the text. She soon finds that she doesn't enjoy watching TV
as much as she thinks she does; that it's probably worth the time to
cook dinner rather than heating up something in the microwave because
it's considerably tastier; that she can't really stand her cubicle
neighbor; and that she thinks about her ex more than she'd have ever
admitted. These thoughts were usually too fleeting to turn into
actions; if she tried to remember them hours later, they'd be folded
into some large story in which these momentary emotions were
secondary. But treating them as notable data points to be taken into
account gives them staying power. Dot starts keeping the TV remote
under the book she's reading to remind herself what entertainment is
more fulfilling. She buys fewer frozen meals and makes sure she's
stocked up on staple ingredients. She agrees to swap cubicles with a
co-worker down the hall. There's not all that much she can do about
the ex, but at least when her friends ask her if everything's okay
between them, she can answer more accurately.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><STRONG>4. Typing </STRONG>(an idea from The<A HREF="#6.The Spotlight|outline">
Spotlight</A>, in which I encourage extracting thoughts into a
visible or audible form so as to allow their inspection without
introspection)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>George is trying to figure out who he is. He's
trying really hard. But when he tries to explain his behaviors and
thoughts in terms of larger patterns that could answer the question,
they inevitably sound suspiciously revisionist and self-serving, like
he's conveniently forgetting some parts and artificially inflating
others. He thinks he's generous, fun at parties, a great family man,
loyal, easygoing. George decides that what he needs to do is catch
what he's thinking at the moment he's thinking it, honestly and
irrevocably, so he'll have an uncorrupted data set to work with. He
fires up a word processor and starts typing, stream of consciousness.
For a few paragraphs, it's mostly &quot;here I am, writing what I
think&quot; and &quot;this is kind of dumb, I wonder if anything will
come of it&quot;, but eventually that gets old, and content starts to
come out. Soon George has a few minutes of inner monologue written
down. He writes the congratulatory things he thinks about himself,
but also notes in parentheses the times he's acted contrary to these
nice patterns (he took three helpings of cake that one time when
there were fewer slices than guests, he spent half of the office
celebration on his cellphone instead of participating, he missed his
daughter's last birthday, he dropped a friend over a sports rivalry,
he blew up when a co-worker reminded him one too many times to finish
that spreadsheet). George writes the bad habits and vices he
demonstrates, too. Most importantly, he resists the urge to hit
backspace, although he freely contradicts himself if there's
something he wants to correct. Then he saves the document, squirrels
it away in a folder, and waits a week. The following Tuesday, he goes
over it like a stranger had written it and notes what he'd think of
this stranger, and what he'd advise him to do.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><STRONG>5. Contradiction </STRONG>(an idea from
<A HREF="#7.Highlights and Shadows|outline">Highlights and Shadows</A>,
in which I explain endorsement and repudiation of one's thoughts and
dispositions)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Penny knows she's not perfect. In fact, some of her
traits and projects seem to outright contradict one another, so she
really <EM>knows </EM>it. She wants to eat better, but she just <EM>loves
</EM>pizza; she's trying to learn anger management, but sometimes
people do things that really <EM>are </EM>wrong and it seems only
suitable that she be upset with them; she's working on her tendency
to nag her boyfriend because she knows it annoys him, but if he can't
learn to put the toilet seat down, maybe he deserves to be annoyed.
Penny decides to take a serious look at the contradictions and make
decisions about which &quot;side&quot; she's on. Eventually, she
concludes that if she's honest with herself, a life without pizza
seems bleak and unrewarding; she'll make that her official exception
to the rule, and work harder to eat better in every other way without
the drag on motivation caused by withholding her one favorite food.
On reflection, being angry - even at people who really do wrong
things - isn't helping her or them, and so she throws herself into
anger management classes with renewed vigor, looking for other, more
productive channels to turn her moral evaluation towards. And -
clearly - the nagging isn't helping its ostensible cause either. She
doesn't endorse that, but she's not going to let her boyfriend's
uncivilized behavior slide either. She'll agree to stop nagging when
he slips up and hope this inspires him to remember more often.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><STRONG>6. Community </STRONG>(an idea from <A HREF="#8.City of Lights|outline">City
of Lights</A>, in which I propose dividing yourself into sub-agents
to tackle complex situations)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Billy has the chance to study abroad in Australia
for a year, and he's so mixed up about it, he can barely think
straight. He can't decide if he wants to go, or why, or how he feels
about the idea of missing it. Eventually, he decides this would be
far easier if all the different nagging voices and clusters of desire
were given names and allowed to talk to each other. He identifies the
major relevant sub-agents as &quot;Clingyness&quot;, which wants to
stay in known surroundings; &quot;Adventurer&quot;, which wants to
seek new experiences and learn about the world; &quot;Obedience to
Advisor&quot;, which wants to do what Prof. So-and-So recommends;
&quot;Academic&quot;, who wants to do whatever will make Billy's
résumé more impressive to future readers; and &quot;Fear of
Spiders&quot;, which would happily go nearly anywhere but the home of
the Sydney funnel-web and is probably responsible for Billy's spooky
dreams. When these voices have a chance to compete with each other,
they expose questionable motivations: for instance, Academic
determines that Prof. So-and-So only recommends staying at Billy's
home institution because Billy is her research assistant, not because
it would further Billy's intellectual growth, which reduces the
comparative power of Obedience to Advisor. Adventurer renders Fear of
Spiders irrelevant by pointing out that the black widow is native to
the United States. Eventually, Academic and Adventurer, in coalition,
beat out Clingyness (whom Billy is not strongly inclined to identify
with), and Billy buys the ticket to Down Under.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><STRONG>7. Experiment </STRONG>(an idea from
<A HREF="#9.Lampshading|outline">Lampshading</A>, where I describe
how to make changes in oneself by setting oneself up to succeed at
operating in accordance with the change, and determining what
underlies the disliked behavior)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Eva bursts into tears whenever she has a hard
problem to deal with, like a stressful project at work or
above-average levels of social drama amongst her friends. This is, of
course, completely unproductive - in fact, in the case of drama, it
worsens things - and Eva wants to stop it. First, she has to figure
out why it happens. Are the tears caused by <EM>sadness?</EM> It
turns out not - she can be brought to tears even by things that don't
make her sad. The latest project from work was exciting and a great
opportunity and it still made her cry. After a little work sorting
through lists of things that make her cry, Eva concludes that it's
linked to how much pressure she feels to solve the problem: for
instance, if she's part of a team that's assigned a project, she's
less likely to react this way than if she's operating solo, and if
her friends embroiled in drama turn to her for help, she'll wind up
tearful more often than if she's just a spectator with no special
responsibility. Now she needs to set herself up not to cry. She
decides to do this by making sure she has social support in her
endeavors: if the boss gives her an assignment, she says to the next
employee over, &quot;I should be able to handle this, but if I need
help, can I count on you?&quot; That way, she can think of the task
as something that isn't entirely on her. When next social drama rears
its head, Eva reconceptualizes her part in the solution as finding
and voicing the group's existing consensus, rather than personally
creating a novel way to make everything better. While this new
approach reduces the incidence of stress tears, it doesn't
disassemble the underlying architecture that causes the tendency in
the first place. That's more complicated to address: Eva spends some
time thinking about why responsibility is such an emotional thing for
her, and looks for ways to duplicate the sense of support she feels
when she has help in situations where she doesn't. Eventually, it is
not much of a risk that Eva will cry if presented with a problem to
solve.</P>
