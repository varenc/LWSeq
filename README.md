Less Wrong Sequences
====================

A repository for sequences that I feel like pulling from Less Wrong and editing by hand into something with better formatting than the scrapers put together.

Sequences:
Living Luminously by Alicorn (http://lesswrong.com/lw/1xh/living_luminously/)
Three Worlds Collide by Eliezer Yudkowsky (http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/)
